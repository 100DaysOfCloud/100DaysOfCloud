## Introduction
I start this challenge, to learn every day doing labs / hands-on to improve my skills in aws cloud.

## Prerequisite
I believe that to start a knowledge of technology is required, such as: processing, storage and communications (networks).

## Use Case
To make the digital output of something, it is required: data processing, storing variables and communicating the results.

Store images from website, receive request to show image, send result and show on web page.

## Cloud Research
I already have the AWS CCP certification and to obtain it, I designed my own learning guide, in which I registered the characteristics of the basic AWS services.
