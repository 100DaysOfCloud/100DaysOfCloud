## Python Notes

Variable

	A container that stores certain info
String

	a collection of alphabets, words or other characters.
	When you are storing a string you do not need quotes " "

Functions 

	a little block of code performing a specfic operation 


num1 = input("Enter a number: ")
num2 = input("Enter another number: ")
result = int(num1) + int(num2) 

INT 

    is looking for a WHOLE number

float 

    is a decimal number


List

    friends=["Kevin", "Karen", "Jim", "Leroy"]
    print(friends[-2])

		The above will print Jim

friends=["Kevin", "Karen", "Jim", "Leroy"]

--> Index position

        Kevin = 0
        Karen = 1
        Jim   = 2
